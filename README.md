# Corvina Sigil Standard (v1)

**Corvina Sigil** is a cultural-signature standard designed to bridge
physical heritage, symbolic value, and digital minting.

This standard defines how unique physical or intellectual artifacts
(such as historical banknotes, documents, or certified works)
may be acknowledged, archived, and represented through
a non-coercive, community-validated digital sigil.

The Corvina Sigil is not a promise, not a security, and not a claim of ownership.
It is a **sign** — a recorded act of guardianship and recognition.

---

## Purpose

The Corvina Sigil Standard exists to:

- Preserve cultural and historical artifacts through transparent custody
- Enable ethical minting linked to verifiable physical deposits
- Support community-based validation without legal enforcement
- Serve as a foundation for future smart contract implementations
- Provide an alternative to cost-intensive, centralized patent systems

---

## Core Principles

- **Physical Anchor**  
  Every sigil corresponds to a real, archived artifact or certified description.

- **Community Witnessing**  
  Validation emerges from transparency and public traceability, not authority.

- **Non-Coercive Design**  
  No legal force, no enforcement — only visibility and reputation.

- **Finite & Verifiable**  
  Each sigil is unique, traceable, and bound to documented parameters.

---

## Relationship to Other Standards

- Works in harmony with the **Y-B Witnessing Model**
- Forms the symbolic layer within the **Corvina Keepers framework**
- Designed to be smart-contract ready, without requiring immediate deployment

---

## Status

- Version: **v1**
- Nature: Foundational, minimal, intentionally conservative
- Governance: Founder-proposed, subject to future community refinement
